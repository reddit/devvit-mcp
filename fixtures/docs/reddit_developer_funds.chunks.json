The Program is focused on reach, and success will be measured by Daily Qualified Engagers and Qualified Installs defined as:\n-   A “Qualified Install” means that a subreddit has your app installed and that subreddit: 1) has a minimum of 1,000 members, and 2) is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Earn Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).\n    \n-   A “Daily Qualified Engager” is a unique user that clicks and takes an action in your App for a specific day that: 1) occurs after April 1, 2025; 2) is logged in; 3) is in a subreddit that has a minimum of 200 members, and 4) is in a subreddit or on content that is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Earn Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).",
