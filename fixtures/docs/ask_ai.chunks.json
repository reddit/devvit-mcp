To make the most of Ask AI:\n-   Be specific. Instead of asking “How do I create a bot?”, try asking “How do I use Reddit’s API to create a comment bot?”\n-   Use follow-up questions to continue the conversation and refine the answer.\n:::note Ask AI is configured to answer questions based on Reddit’s documentation and code examples. It’s not a general LLM and can’t answer questions about your specific system, other platforms, or the meaning of life. :::",
