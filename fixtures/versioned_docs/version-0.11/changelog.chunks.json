This page logs the changes to each version of Devvit.\nBefore upgrading `@devvit/public-api` in your project, always update the CLI first by running `npm install -g devvit`.\n## Devvit 0.11.14: App versions panel, gallery image support, and some smaller fixes\n**Release Date: May 6, 2025**\nWe’ve released a new [app version panel](./publishing.md#app-versions) that lets you track all the versions of your app, so you can see your app’s status, visibility, and number of installations for each app version. The panel displays the most recent versions of your app, and you can download a complete list of published versions via CSV.\n**Other fixes**  \nThis release also includes some small but mighty fixes:\n-   Public API\n    \n    -   Added support for gallery media on Post objects\n    -   Fixed the issue where `Post.delete()` was not throwing an error on an unsuccessful delete call\n-   Settings\n    \n    -   Added the ability to define and aggregate multiple addSettings calls\n-   CLI\n    \n    -   Fixed issue with redirect links containing \\* for Windows users\n    -   Added a `--withdraw` flag to `devvit publish` that allows you to withdraw an app you previously published\n    -   Added handling for UTF-16 encoded READMEs, and if a README’s encoding isn’t understood at upload time, the CLI will let you know",

Our most successful apps, like [Pixelary](https://reddit.com/r/pixelary) and [Riddonkulous](https://www.reddit.com/r/riddonkulous/), leverage the creativity of the community by allowing users to create content as they play. This has helped these games grow quickly! The user actions API:\n-   **Boosts engagement**. Automatically sharing content increases reach, facilitates user interaction, and gives you insight into what’s working in your app.\n-   **Saves the user time and effort**. It’s easy for users to jump into the conversation.\n-   **Improves retention**. When people interact with your app, they’re more likely to stick around, and continued user engagement helps your app reach new people. Total positive feedback loop!",

This release includes a new, experimental [useAsync](working_with_useasync.md) feature that allows you to fetch data in a non-blocking way and a new hook architecture that lets you build composable hooks.\nThese platform upgrades create breaking changes for some apps. We’re releasing 0.11.0 on [@Next](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/next/) (the experimental branch of Devvit), so current app functionality will still work as you migrate your apps over to the updated platform.\nTo get started on 0.11.0:\n-   Run `npm install -g devvit`.\n-   Run `devvit update app` and `npm i` to update your app.\n**New Features**\n-   **Faster rendering**. `useAsync` is a new hook that lets you fetch data without blocking the render. This is an experimental feature that we will be iterating on over time.\n-   **Composable hooks**. Now you can create hooks that can be shared across projects. While you could do this with the old hooks off context, rendering bugs prevented you from using them in various parts of your app. With this release you can abstract everything into hooks.",

This change improves the performance of your app and makes it easier to write shareable hooks.\n```ts\n// Old pattern\nimport { Devvit } from '@devvit/public-api';\n\nconst MyComponent = (context) => {\n  const [count, setCount] = context.useState(0);\n\n  return <hstack></hstack>;\n};\n\n// New pattern\nimport { Devvit, useState } from '@devvit/public-api';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return <hstack></hstack>;\n};\n```\n-   API methods related to Reddit's Post Collections functionality have been removed, as the [feature was removed from Reddit several months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1am4b0e/deprecating_post_collections_mark_as_oc_and/).\n**Improvements and updates**\n**CLI**\n-   Improved error messaging\n    -   Pass 4xx errors up to developers\n    -   Ensure stack traces have the full path in message\n    -   New playtest error for app not yet existing\n    -   New error for apps blocked on upload due to asset folder sizes\n-   Improved image asset upload batching\n-   Added retry calls from CLI to Portal that fail\n-   `devvit new --help` output fixed",

Previously, hook errors were firing in valid use cases. Hook rules still apply. If you see this error: `Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called at the top-level of a function component. Make sure that you are not calling hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.`, it is most likely caused by an error inside of your code.",
