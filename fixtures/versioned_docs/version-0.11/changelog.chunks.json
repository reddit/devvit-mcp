This page logs the changes to each version of Devvit.\nBefore upgrading `@devvit/public-api` in your project, always update the CLI first by running `npm install -g devvit`.\n## Devvit 0.11.18: Playtest subreddits and CLI improvements\n**Release Date: Jul 1, 2025**\nWe made app development even smoother with auto-generated [playtest subreddits](./playtest.md). When you run `devvit upload` for the first time, u/devvit-dev-bot automatically creates a playtest subreddit for your app that:\n-   Is private by default\n-   Makes you a moderator automatically\n-   Has your app pre-installed and ready to test\n-   Allows admins to join\nJust run `devvit playtest` to use the auto-generated subreddit.\nYou can also still use your own subreddits for playtesting (with fewer than 200 subscribers) by specifying the subreddit in the CLI or adding a default subreddit in your app. Learn more about playtesting [here](./playtest.md#playtest-on-an-alternate-subreddit).",

(Note that this update does require a forced update to take effect.)\nUse `npm install -g devvit@latest` to update your CLI .\n:::note If you’re using Devvit Web (Experimental) templates or Bolt, you should only update Devvit CLI locally by running `npm i devvit@latest`. :::\n**And a shout-out**\nSpecial thanks to u/antboiy for updating `Comment.ApprovedAt` in our typedoc. We love community contributions!\n## Devvit 0.11.17: Easier fetch domain requests\n**Release Date: June 16, 2025**\nWe’ve simplified how to request new domains for HTTP fetch (no more forms!).

Now you’ll see less of this annoying error: _your local version number doesn't match the server, do you want to continue anyway?_. Versions are handled on our server, and existing versions in devvit.yaml will not update or have any effect on uploads.\n    \n-   **Require the latest CLI version to playtest**. You need to be on the latest version of the CLI in order to playtest your app properly. The latest CLI is now required to `devvit playtest` (just like it is for `devvit upload`). Things to note:\n    \n    -   Updating your CLI does not require you to update your app code / devvit SDK (i.e. you do NOT have to run devvit update app to playtest).\n        \n    -   You can update your CLI by doing `npm install -g devvit@latest`\n        \n-   **Ensure @devvit/payments and @devvit/public-api have the same version**. Unexpected behavior resulted from mismatched payments and public api versions. Going forward, if you’re using payments the versions need to be the same.\n    \n-   **Small security fix** - Thanks to a [community report](https://github.com/reddit/devvit/pull/180), we implemented a small CLI security fix.",

Our most successful apps, like [Pixelary](https://reddit.com/r/pixelary) and [Riddonkulous](https://www.reddit.com/r/riddonkulous/), leverage the creativity of the community by allowing users to create content as they play. This has helped these games grow quickly! The user actions API:\n-   **Boosts engagement**. Automatically sharing content increases reach, facilitates user interaction, and gives you insight into what’s working in your app.\n-   **Saves the user time and effort**. It’s easy for users to jump into the conversation.\n-   **Improves retention**. When people interact with your app, they’re more likely to stick around, and continued user engagement helps your app reach new people. Total positive feedback loop!",

    "pageContent": "<path>Changelog, Devvit 0.11.0: Platform updates, breaking changes, and useAsync</path>\n**Release Date: October 9, 2024**\nOne of the biggest issues for devs who are building experiences is that data fetching slows down the render of the app. Devvit 0.11.0 introduces a new platform architecture for improved performance and scalability. This release includes a new, experimental [useAsync](working_with_useasync.md) feature that allows you to fetch data in a non-blocking way and a new hook architecture that lets you build composable hooks.\nThese platform upgrades create breaking changes for some apps. We’re releasing 0.11.0 on [@Next](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/next/) (the experimental branch of Devvit), so current app functionality will still work as you migrate your apps over to the updated platform.\nTo get started on 0.11.0:\n-   Run `npm install -g devvit`.\n-   Run `devvit update app` and `npm i` to update your app.\n**New Features**\n-   **Faster rendering**. `useAsync` is a new hook that lets you fetch data without blocking the render. This is an experimental feature that we will be iterating on over time.\n-   **Composable hooks**. Now you can create hooks that can be shared across projects. While you could do this with the old hooks off context, rendering bugs prevented you from using them in various parts of your app. With this release you can abstract everything into hooks.",

Previously, hook errors were firing in valid use cases. Hook rules still apply. If you see this error: `Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called at the top-level of a function component. Make sure that you are not calling hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.`, it is most likely caused by an error inside of your code.",
