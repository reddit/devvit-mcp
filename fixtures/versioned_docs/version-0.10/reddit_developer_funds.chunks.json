This program is focused on reach, and success will be measured by Qualified Views and Qualified Installs, defined as:\n-   A “Qualified View” is a view of your App that: 1) occurs after July 1, 2024; 2) lasts at least two seconds; 3) is in a subreddit that has a minimum of 1,000 members; and 4) is in a subreddit or on content that is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Contributor Monetization Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).\n    \n-   A “Qualified Install” means that a subreddit has your App installed and that subreddit: 1) has a minimum of 1,000 members; and 2) is eligible for monetization under Reddit’s Contributor Monetization Policy (e.g., that is Safe for Work).",
